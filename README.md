# Weather-Dashboard
A searchable, weather forecast application.

## Description

This webpage provides a Weather Forecast Dashboard with third-party weather data provided by OpenWeather via an API key. When the user views the webpage, they can search for a city by name and then they are shown the current weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The API key also calls for the next 5 days of forecasted weather data to be displayed after the city has been searched. Additionally, the 10 previously searched cities are stored within local storage and displayed as clickable links for the user to revisit with updated weather data. This website also includes a navigation bar with clickable links leading the user to my GitHub profile, personal portfolio, and provides the ability to send an email directly to me. The webpage also includes a footer with contact information, copyright disclaimer, and the web API data source.
